YOLA COAT WOMEN'S
The Yola takes premium down insulation and crafts a contemporary shape with the benefit of sleek, thermally efficient construction. Technical supporting materials and insulation add longevity and an extended range of effectiveness to a mid-thigh length coat styled for mountain town weekends and contemporary city living. Warm and comfortable, the Yola is filled with 750 fill power European grey goose down for efficient, effective insulation. Lightweight, water resistant Teprine™ nylon shell fabric is downproof, with a soft sheen. Freedom of movement is built in with articulated sleeves and gusseted underarms.

MOVE ABOUT TOWN
Life moves fast, no matter how cold it gets, so movement and ergonomic freedom are essential. Arc’teryx designs for bodies in motion by strategically placing gussets at key areas and building articulation into the pattern. In an insulated coat like the Yola, the benefit is warmth and protection without the binding and stiffness.

DOWN COMPOSITE MAPPING
Arc’teryx Down Composite Mapping technology is used to put the Yola’s goose down where it’s needed most, and synthetic insulation where contact with moisture may occur. The result is increased performance in mixed conditions coupled with a more streamlined fit. This use of specific insulations to address specific performance issues extends the Yola’s effectiveness into a greater range of conditions.

CERIUM HOODY WOMEN'S
Worn as a midlayer or standalone, the Cerium has emerged as a go-to for virtually any alpine undertaking. Seeking to take it higher, we refined the design and sourced more sustainable materials while maintaining its exceptional warmth-to-weight ratio and packability. Responsibly-sourced 850 fill down – with Coreloft™ synthetic utilized in areas prone to moisture – provides premium insulation. The outer – recycled 15D Arato™ nylon – is light and durable, a bio-derived liner reduces petroleum use, and the insulated StormHood™ extends the warmth.

Size and Fit Tips: The Ceriums offer more room in the body than their predecessors, the Cerium LTs, for improved comfort, versatility, and freedom of movement.

Fitted Fit - This trimmer fit is patterned to stay close to the body through the chest, waist, hip, and thigh. Its low profile eliminates bulk, moves with the body, and fits comfortably over our first layers. This model's fit has evolved. Before you check out, please make sure to reference our sizing chart to determine your correct size.

CERIUM HOODY WOMEN'S
Worn as a midlayer or standalone, the Cerium has emerged as a go-to for virtually any alpine undertaking. Seeking to take it higher, we refined the design and sourced more sustainable materials while maintaining its exceptional warmth-to-weight ratio and packability. Responsibly-sourced 850 fill down – with Coreloft™ synthetic utilized in areas prone to moisture – provides premium insulation. The outer – recycled 15D Arato™ nylon – is light and durable, a bio-derived liner reduces petroleum use, and the insulated StormHood™ extends the warmth.

Size and Fit Tips: The Ceriums offer more room in the body than their predecessors, the Cerium LTs, for improved comfort, versatility, and freedom of movement.

Fitted Fit - This trimmer fit is patterned to stay close to the body through the chest, waist, hip, and thigh. Its low profile eliminates bulk, moves with the body, and fits comfortably over our first layers. This model's fit has evolved. Before you check out, please make sure to reference our sizing chart to determine your correct size.
